# 🧬 Cancer Diagnosis with Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow for predicting **cancer diagnosis** using patient health and lifestyle data. The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle** and contains features such as **age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, genetic risk, physical activity, alcohol intake, and cancer history**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

* 🔧 Data preprocessing and label encoding
* 📊 Exploratory data analysis & visualization
* 🤖 Model training with **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**
* 🎯 Performance evaluation using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**
* 🖼️ Confusion matrices & bar plots for comparison

The goal is to build **reliable and interpretable models** that support better understanding of cancer risk factors and assist in diagnosis.
